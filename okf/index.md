# OCCTSwift

The foundation of the ecosystem: a Swift package wrapping **OpenCASCADE Technology (OCCT)** for
B-Rep solid modelling on Apple platforms. A Swift 6 API layer (`OCCTSwift`) sits over an
Objective-C++ bridge (`OCCTBridge`) to a prebuilt OCCT binary (`OCCT.xcframework`), targeting
iOS 15+, macOS 12+, visionOS 1+, and tvOS 15+.

## Role in the ecosystem

- **Cluster:** kernel
- **Depends on:** nothing intra-org — this is the dependency root. Its only build input is the
  bundled `OCCT.xcframework` (OpenCASCADE), fetched from a GitHub release.
- **Feeds:** every other kernel library and, transitively, all CAD products. Dependents declare
  `depends_on: [OCCTSwift]` in their own manifests.

## Components

See [`components/`](components/index.md) — the API is organised by OCCT domain (foundation, math,
geometry, topology, modelling, mesh, shape-healing, I/O, XCAF, analysis, drawing).

## References

See [`references/`](references/index.md) — OpenCASCADE upstream and licensing (LGPL + exception).

## Notes

- Binary target auto-selects a local `Libraries/OCCT.xcframework` (path-dep / dev) or the remote
  release zip (URL / CI); see `Package.swift` for the `#filePath`-based detection.
- Published to the Swift Package Index via `.spi.yml`.
