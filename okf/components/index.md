# Components

`OCCTSwift` exposes one Swift API surface (the `OCCTSwift` target over the `OCCTBridge`
Objective-C++ layer), organised by OCCT domain. Domains, mirrored by the per-domain test targets:

- **Foundation** — core types, handles, collections
- **Math** — vectors, matrices, precision
- **Geometry (2D/3D)** — `Geom2d`, curves, surfaces
- **Topology** — shapes, the topology graph
- **Modeling** — primitives, booleans, fillets, sweeps
- **Mesh** — triangulation / tessellation
- **Shape Healing** — repair, sewing, fixing
- **I/O** — STEP / IGES / STL / BREP read & write
- **XCAF** — extended data (colours, assemblies, metadata)
- **Analysis** — properties, measurement
- **Drawing** — 2D projection / drawing extraction

Add one `<domain>.md` here as each domain's API is documented in depth.
