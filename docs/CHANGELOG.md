## Release History

### v0.169.0 (May 2026) — Mesh + export progress (issue #98 follow-up)

Extends the `ImportProgress` channel from v0.168 to two more long-running OCCT operations called out as out-of-scope in the original issue: `BRepMesh_IncrementalMesh::Perform` and the STEP / IGES writers. Same protocol, same cancellation contract.

**New Swift API**:

```swift
extension Shape {
    /// Run BRepMesh_IncrementalMesh with progress + cooperative cancellation.
    /// Throws ImportError.cancelled if cancelled.
    @discardableResult
    public func meshWithProgress(
        linearDeflection: Double = 0.1,
        angularDeflection: Double = 0.5,
        progress: ImportProgress? = nil
    ) throws -> Shape
}

extension Exporter {
    /// Export a shape to STEP with progress + cancellation.
    /// Throws ExportError.cancelled if cancelled.
    public static func writeSTEP(shape: Shape, to url: URL, progress: ImportProgress?) throws

    /// Export a shape to IGES with progress + cancellation.
    public static func writeIGES(shape: Shape, to url: URL, progress: ImportProgress?) throws
}

extension Document {
    /// Write the document to a STEP file with progress + cancellation.
    /// Throws ImportError.cancelled if cancelled.
    public func writeSTEP(to url: URL, progress: ImportProgress?) throws
}

extension ExportError {
    case cancelled
}
```

**Bridge plumbing**: 5 new entry points (`OCCTShapeIncrementalMeshProgress`, `OCCTExportSTEPProgress`, `OCCTExportSTEPWithModeProgress`, `OCCTExportIGESProgress`, `OCCTDocumentWriteSTEPProgress`) reusing the existing `BridgeProgressIndicator` from v0.168. `BRepMesh_IncrementalMesh::Perform(Message_ProgressRange&)`, `STEPControl_Writer::Transfer(...range)`, `IGESControl_Writer::AddShape(...range)`, and `STEPCAFControl_Writer::Transfer(...range)` all accept the indicator's progress range.

**Why `ImportProgress` is the type for export too**: it's the same channel — progress + cancel. Adding parallel `ExportProgress`/`MeshProgress` protocols would multiply types without functional benefit. The protocol name reads slightly oddly in export contexts; pre-1.0 we accept that, and v1.0 will likely rename to `OperationProgress`.

6 new tests cover meshing progress + cancellation, STEP/IGES export with `progress: nil` (back-compat), STEP export progress fires, and `Document.writeSTEP(to:progress:)` round-trip.

### v0.168.0 (May 2026) — STEP/IGES import progress + cancellation (issue #98)

Wraps OCCT's `Message_ProgressIndicator` so callers of `Shape.loadSTEP / loadIGES / loadIGESRobust` and `Document.load / loadSTEP` can observe progress and cooperatively cancel long-running imports.

**New Swift API**:

```swift
public protocol ImportProgress: AnyObject, Sendable {
    func progress(fraction: Double, step: String)
    func shouldCancel() -> Bool   // default: false
}

extension ImportError {
    case cancelled
}

extension Shape {
    public static func loadSTEP(from url: URL, progress: ImportProgress? = nil) throws -> Shape
    public static func loadSTEP(from url: URL, unitInMeters: Double, progress: ImportProgress? = nil) throws -> Shape
    public static func loadIGES(from url: URL, progress: ImportProgress? = nil) throws -> Shape
    public static func loadIGESRobust(from url: URL, progress: ImportProgress? = nil) throws -> Shape
}

extension Document {
    public static func load(from url: URL, progress: ImportProgress? = nil) throws -> Document
    public static func loadSTEP(from url: URL, progress: ImportProgress? = nil) throws -> Document
    public static func loadSTEP(from url: URL, modes: STEPReaderModes, progress: ImportProgress?) throws -> Document
}
```

`progress: nil` (the default) keeps existing call sites source-compatible — no behavioural change for callers that haven't opted in.

**Bridge plumbing**: 7 new `*Progress` C entry points in `OCCTBridge` plus an internal `BridgeProgressIndicator` subclass of `Message_ProgressIndicator` that forwards `Show()` to a Swift callback (via opaque `userData` + `@convention(c)` trampoline) and reports `UserBreak() == true` when the Swift `shouldCancel()` returns true. `STEPControl_Reader::TransferRoots`, `IGESControl_Reader::TransferRoots`, and `STEPCAFControl_Reader::Transfer` all accept the indicator's progress range.

**Cancellation contract**: `shouldCancel()` is polled at OCCT's progress checkpoints (typically once per transferred entity). Returning `true` causes the loader to throw `ImportError.cancelled` at the next boundary. The shape / document is not partially constructed.

4 new tests cover (1) progress callback fires for a round-tripped STEP file, (2) `progress: nil` back-compat path still works, (3) cancellation flag honored, (4) `Document.load` progress.

**Driver**: unblocks [OCCTSwiftTools](https://github.com/gsdali/OCCTSwiftTools) v0.4.0 — its `CADFileLoader.load(from:format:)` async API can now pass `progress` straight through, giving OCCTSwiftAIS' file-open dialog a real progress bar and cancel button "for free".

### v0.167.0 (May 2026) — visionOS + tvOS support

OCCT.xcframework now ships **seven slices**:

| Platform | Slice |
|---|---|
| macOS 12+ arm64 | `macos-arm64` |
| iOS 15+ device arm64 | `ios-arm64` |
| iOS 15+ Simulator arm64 | `ios-arm64-simulator` |
| visionOS 1+ device arm64 | `xros-arm64` (new) |
| visionOS 1+ Simulator arm64 | `xros-arm64-simulator` (new) |
| tvOS 15+ device arm64 | `tvos-arm64` (new) |
| tvOS 15+ Simulator arm64 | `tvos-arm64-simulator` (new) |

`Package.swift` declares `.visionOS(.v1)` and `.tvOS(.v15)` alongside the existing `.iOS(.v15)` / `.macOS(.v12)`. The xcframework asset attached to this release is ~341 MB (up from 148 MB at v0.165.0; quadruples the slice count).

**Build script changes** (`Scripts/build-occt.sh`) — required to make OCCT 8 cross-compile cleanly to visionOS and tvOS SDKs:

- Added four new build blocks (`visionOS device`, `visionOS Simulator`, `tvOS device`, `tvOS Simulator`).
- Each new block sets `-DCMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P=8` to bypass OCCT's `OCCT_MAKE_COMPILER_BITNESS` cmake macro, which couldn't autodetect pointer size on the visionOS SDK (`32 + 32*(/8)` syntax error from an empty `CMAKE_C_SIZEOF_DATA_PTR`).
- Removed explicit `-mtargetos=` / `-m*-version-min=` flags from the C/CXX flags — clang rejects them when CMake already sets `--target=arm64-apple-xros1.0` from the SDK + deployment target. Letting CMake derive the target is the correct path.
- xcframework creation step now conditionally includes each platform slice: if a slice fails to build (empty `.a`), the xcframework is built without it instead of aborting the whole script.

`OCCT.xcframework.zip` checksum: `5147b7d65cd9af5a6c3af1b38a1492365e645ed5c76a663bf9311c2f54043d87`.

### v0.166.1 (May 2026) — Platform plan refinement

Metadata-only patch revising the v1.0.0 platform expansion plan:

- **Dropped Intel Mac (`macOS x86_64`).** Apple is winding down Intel macOS support; not worth the build slot.
- **visionOS confirmed for v1.0.0.** Device + simulator slices.
- **tvOS reduced to "if cheap".** Will only add if it falls out of the visionOS work without extra effort.
- **Linux / Windows / Android — moved to "under review"** with a full analysis in [docs/platform-expansion.md](../docs/platform-expansion.md). Headline: Linux is the strongest non-Apple candidate (~2 weeks of focused work), Windows is medium-risk, Android should wait for Swift-on-Android packaging to stabilize. The prerequisite for any non-Apple port is the OCCTBridge `.mm` → `.cpp` audit, which is independently useful.

### v0.166.0 (May 2026) — Swift Package Index readiness

Preparation for a public listing on [Swift Package Index](https://swiftpackageindex.com) alongside v1.0.0. No code changes; metadata only.

**Added:**

- `.spi.yml` — SPI build matrix declaration:
  - macOS via SPM on Swift 6.0, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3
  - iOS on Swift 6.3
  - DocC documentation target: `OCCTSwift`
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` — short pointer to Contributor Covenant 2.1 with reports email.
- README:
  - SPI shields.io badges (Swift versions, platforms) — activate once the package is added to SPI.
  - Updated install snippet from stale `from: "0.128.0"` to current `from: "0.165.0"`.
  - "Supported Platforms" table covering current support and v1.0.0 expansion plan (Intel Mac, visionOS).
  - Documented Swift 6.1+ verified clean against 6.1 / 6.2 / 6.3 toolchains.

**Submission gating:** waiting until v1.0.0 ships (May 7, 2026, alongside OCCT 8.0.0 GA) before submitting to SPI. v0.166 makes the repo submission-ready.

### v0.165.0 (May 2026) — Fix SPM xcframework URL (issue #97)

`Package.swift` had its remote `binaryTarget(url:)` hardcoded to the **v0.131.0** xcframework — predating OCCT 8 by months. SPM consumers pinning `from: "0.157.0"` resolved the version correctly but the build failed at compile-time with `'BRepGraph_MeshView.hxx' file not found` because the v0.131.0 binary was built against rc-era OCCT and didn't ship the beta1 headers that the v0.157+ wrappers reference. Local-path consumers were unaffected (the auto-detect picks up `Libraries/OCCT.xcframework`).

This release:

1. Attaches the current beta1 xcframework as a release asset (`OCCT.xcframework.zip`, ~148 MB).
2. Updates `Package.swift`'s remote URL to point at the v0.165.0 release and bumps the SPM checksum to `99bba63c0e686195512cfaa4f3f46f9f11c8b6cd89e8fe5b8aed872a48978003`.

After this release, `from: "0.165.0"` resolves cleanly for remote-pin consumers and the v0.157.0 → v0.164.0 wrapper surface (MeshView, MeshCache, EditorView mutation, ProductOps, RepOps + cache inspection) becomes usable downstream. Downstream Package.swift consumers should bump their pin to `from: "0.165.0"`.

No new ops; this is purely a packaging fix.

### v0.164.0 (May 2026) — RepOps non-guard setters & cache entry inspection (21 ops)

Final wrapping pass for OCCT 8.0.0 beta1 BRepGraph surface. After this release, the public surface of `BRepGraph::EditorView` and `BRepGraph::MeshView` is exhaustively wrapped on `TopologyGraph`.

**RepOps non-guard setters** — swap geometry / mesh content bound to an existing rep id without recreating the rep:

```swift
graph.repSetSurface(repId, surface: newSurface)
graph.repSetCurve3D(repId, curve: newCurve3D)
graph.repSetCurve2D(repId, curve: newCurve2D)
graph.repSetTriangulation(repId, triangulation: newTri)
graph.repSetPolygon3D(repId, polygon: newPoly3D)
graph.repSetPolygon2D(repId, polygon: newPoly2D)
graph.repSetPolygonOnTri(repId, polygon: newPolyOnTri)
graph.repSetPolygonOnTriTriangulationId(polyOnTriRepId, triRepId: newTriRepId)
```

**Cache entry inspection** — detailed access to the algorithm-derived cache tier for diagnostics and non-destructive mesh tooling:

```swift
graph.cachedFaceMeshIsPresent(0)              // Bool
graph.cachedFaceMeshTriRepCount(0)            // Int
graph.cachedFaceMeshActiveIndex(0)            // Int (-1 if absent)
graph.cachedFaceMeshStoredOwnGen(0)           // UInt32 (cache freshness gen)
graph.cachedFaceMeshTriRepId(0, repIndex: 0)  // Int? (active or specific entry)

graph.cachedEdgeMeshIsPresent(0)
graph.cachedEdgeMeshPolygon3DRepId(0)
graph.cachedEdgeMeshStoredOwnGen(0)

graph.cachedCoEdgeMeshIsPresent(0)
graph.cachedCoEdgeMeshPolygon2DRepId(0)
graph.cachedCoEdgeMeshPolygonOnTriRepCount(0)
graph.cachedCoEdgeMeshPolygonOnTriRepId(0, repIndex: 0)
graph.cachedCoEdgeMeshStoredOwnGen(0)
```

The `StoredOwnGen` accessors expose the cache freshness generation — pair with the entity's current OwnGen (via existing readers) to detect stale cache entries.

3 new tests cover fresh-graph absence, post-`appendCachedTriangulation` state readback, and edge/coedge cache absence.

### v0.163.0 (May 2026) — EditorView ProductOps assembly building (5 ops)

Closes the **EditorView mutation surface**. With v0.163.0 the public mutation API of `BRepGraph::EditorView` is fully wrapped on `TopologyGraph`.

```swift
let parent = graph.createEmptyProduct()!
let child = graph.linkProductToTopology(
    shapeRootKind: 0, shapeRootIndex: 0,
    placement: TopologyGraph.identityLocationMatrix)!
let linked = graph.linkProducts(
    parentProductIndex: parent,
    referencedProductIndex: child,
    placement: TopologyGraph.identityLocationMatrix)!
// linked.occurrenceIndex, linked.occurrenceRefIndex

graph.productRemoveOccurrence(parent, occurrenceRefIndex: linked.occurrenceRefIndex)
graph.productRemoveShapeRoot(child)
```

`linkProductToTopology` accepts `placement: nil` for an identity placement. `linkProducts` takes a `parentOccurrenceIndex: Int?` (nil for unparented).

2 new tests cover the create/link path and remove-with-bogus-ids no-crash safety.

### v0.162.0 (May 2026) — EditorView geometric setters, location setters, PCurve API (16 ops)

Closes the EditorView wrapping started in v0.159.0. With v0.162.0 the public mutation surface of `BRepGraph::EditorView` is fully wrapped on `TopologyGraph`.

**CoEdge geometric setters:**
- `setCoEdgeUVBox(_:u1:v1:u2:v2:)`
- `setCoEdgeContinuity` / `setCoEdgeSeamContinuity` (GeomAbs_Shape: 0=C0, 1=C1, 2=C2, 3=C3, 4=CN)
- `setCoEdgeSeamPairId`

**Face geometric setter:**
- `setFaceTriangulationRep(_:triRepId:)` — bind the active triangulation to a face's persistent tier (vs `appendCachedTriangulation` for the cache tier)

**CoEdge PCurve API** (uses existing `Curve2D` Swift type):
- `coEdgeCreateCurve2DRep(_ curve2D:)` → rep id
- `coEdgeSetPCurve(_ coedgeIndex:curve2D:)` (pass nil to clear)
- `coEdgeAddPCurve(edgeIndex:faceIndex:curve2D:first:last:orientation:)`

**Location setters via 12-double 3x4 matrix** (`gp_Trsf::SetValues` row-major convention):
- `setVertexRefLocalLocation`, `setCoEdgeRefLocalLocation`, `setWireRefLocalLocation`
- `setFaceRefLocalLocation`, `setShellRefLocalLocation`, `setSolidRefLocalLocation`
- `setOccurrenceRefLocalLocation`, `setChildRefLocalLocation`
- Convenience: `TopologyGraph.identityLocationMatrix` returns the 3x4 identity

3 new tests cover CoEdge geometric setters on real coedges, identity-matrix location setters on real refs, and face-triangulation binding with MeshView readback.

### v0.161.0 (May 2026) — EditorView Add / Remove / Ref setters (41 ops)

Continues the EditorView wrapping started in v0.159.0 with the structural-mutation surface:

**Add operations** (return ref id or nil):
- `edgeAddInternalVertex(_:vertexIndex:orientation:)`
- `faceAddVertex(_:vertexIndex:orientation:)`
- `shellAddChild(_:childKind:childIndex:orientation:)`
- `solidAddChild(_:childKind:childIndex:orientation:)`
- `compoundAddChild(_:childKind:childIndex:orientation:)`
- `compSolidAddSolid(_:solidIndex:orientation:)`

**Remove operations** (return Bool indicating active-usage removal):
- `edgeRemoveVertex`, `edgeReplaceVertex` (returns new ref id)
- `wireRemoveCoEdge`, `faceRemoveVertex`, `faceRemoveWire`
- `shellRemoveFace`, `shellRemoveChild`
- `solidRemoveShell`, `solidRemoveChild`
- `compoundRemoveChild`, `compSolidRemoveSolid`
- `removeRep(repKind:repIndex:)` — generic representation removal

**Ref setters** (entity-ref → entity-def rebinding, orientation, rep-id binding):
- Vertex: `setVertexRefOrientation`, `setVertexRefVertexDefId`
- Edge: `setEdgeStartVertexRefId`, `setEdgeEndVertexRefId`, `setEdgeCurve3DRepId`, `setEdgePolygon3DRepId`
- CoEdge: `setCoEdgeRefCoEdgeDefId`, `setCoEdgeEdgeDefId`, `setCoEdgeFaceDefId`, `setCoEdgeCurve2DRepId`, `setCoEdgePolygon2DRepId`, `setCoEdgePolygonOnTriRepId`, `clearCoEdgePCurveBinding`
- Wire: `setWireRefIsOuter`, `setWireRefOrientation`, `setWireRefWireDefId`
- Face: `setFaceSurfaceRepId`, `setFaceRefOrientation`, `setFaceRefFaceDefId`
- Shell: `setShellRefOrientation`, `setShellRefShellDefId`
- Solid: `setSolidRefOrientation`, `setSolidRefSolidDefId`
- Occurrence: `setOccurrenceChildDefId`, `setOccurrenceRefOccurrenceDefId`
- Generic: `setChildRefOrientation`, `setChildRefChildDefId`

Setters that need `TopLoc_Location` or `Bnd_Box2d` (e.g. `*RefLocalLocation`, `CoEdge.SetUVBox`, `CoEdge.SetContinuity`) are deferred until a 12-double / 4-double calling convention lands in the bridge.

3 new tests cover Add no-crash safety, Remove returning false on bogus ref ids, and Ref setters operating on real box ids without crashing.

### v0.160.0 (May 2026) — MeshCache write API + new `Triangulation` type

Completes the OCCT 8.0.0 beta1 two-tier mesh storage wrapping started in v0.158.0. The cache write side — `BRepGraph_Tool::Mesh` static helpers — is now exposed on `TopologyGraph`, and a new `Triangulation` Swift class wraps `Handle<Poly_Triangulation>` for input.

**New `Triangulation` class** (mirrors the existing `Polygon3D` / `PolygonOnTriangulation` pattern):

```swift
let tri = Triangulation.create(
    nodes: [SIMD3(0,0,0), SIMD3(1,0,0), SIMD3(0,1,0), SIMD3(1,1,0)],
    triangles: [0,1,2, 1,3,2]
)!
tri.nodeCount        // 4
tri.triangleCount    // 2
tri.node(at: 0)      // SIMD3(0, 0, 0)
tri.triangle(at: 0)  // (0, 1, 2)
tri.deflection = 0.01
```

Vertex indices are 0-based on the Swift boundary; the bridge handles OCCT's 1-based convention internally.

**MeshCache write API** on `TopologyGraph`:

```swift
let triRepId = graph.createTriangulationRep(tri)!
graph.appendCachedTriangulation(faceIndex: 0, triRepId: triRepId)
graph.setCachedActiveIndex(faceIndex: 0, activeIndex: 0)

let polyRepId = graph.createPolygon3DRep(polygon3d)!
graph.setCachedPolygon3D(edgeIndex: 0, polyRepId: polyRepId)

let polyOnTriRepId = graph.createPolygonOnTriRep(polygonOnTri, triRepId: triRepId)!
graph.appendCachedPolygonOnTri(coedgeIndex: 0, polyRepId: polyOnTriRepId)
graph.setCachedPolygon2D(coedgeIndex: 0, poly2DRepId: ...)
```

This unblocks downstream tooling (OCCTMCP, OCCTSwiftScripts) that wants to populate algorithm-derived mesh data on a graph without touching the persistent (STEP-imported) tier — important for non-destructive meshing workflows.

4 new tests cover Triangulation construction round-trip, malformed-input rejection, and rep-creation + face/edge binding with subsequent MeshView readback.

### v0.159.0 (May 2026) — EditorView field setters

OCCT 8.0.0 beta1's `BRepGraph::EditorView` exposes per-entity `Ops` classes with `Set*` methods that mutate field-level data on existing graph entities (without requiring a full topology rebuild). v0.159.0 wraps the simple-value subset (scalars, bools, orientations) on the `TopologyGraph` Swift type:

**VertexOps** — `setVertexPoint(_:x:y:z:)`, `setVertexTolerance(_:tolerance:)`

**EdgeOps** — `setEdgeTolerance`, `setEdgeParamRange(_:first:last:)`, `setEdgeSameParameter`, `setEdgeSameRange`, `setEdgeDegenerate`, `setEdgeIsClosed`

**CoEdgeOps** — `setCoEdgeParamRange`, `setCoEdgeOrientation` (Forward/Reversed/Internal/External as Int 0–3)

**WireOps** — `setWireIsClosed`

**FaceOps** — `setFaceTolerance`, `setFaceNaturalRestriction`

**ShellOps** — `setShellIsClosed`

All 14 setters are pass-through to the corresponding `g.Editor().<Entity>().Set*(...)` on the OCCT side. Invalid ids are no-ops (try/catch in bridge). Setters that require new opaque types — `SetPCurve`, `SetSurfaceRepId`, `SetTriangulationRep`, `Mut*` RAII guards — are deferred. Same with `Add*` / `Remove*` mutation methods that aren't already wrapped via the Builder bridge functions.

Driver: lets headless tooling (OCCTMCP, OCCTSwiftScripts) tweak field-level data after constructing a graph (e.g. relax a tolerance, mark an edge degenerate) without round-tripping through `TopoDS_Shape` rebuilds.

4 new tests cover set-then-read-back where a getter exists, plus no-crash safety on the readback-less setters.

### v0.158.0 (May 2026) — MeshView two-tier mesh storage (read API)

OCCT 8.0.0 beta1 introduced a two-tier mesh storage model: an algorithm-derived **cache** (populated by `BRepGraphMesh`) and the **persistent** tier (mesh data imported from STEP, stored in topology definitions). v0.158.0 wraps the read-side of this model — `BRepGraph::MeshView` queries — exposing it on the existing `TopologyGraph` Swift type:

- Counts: `polygon2DCount`, `polygonOnTriCount`, `activeTriangulationCount`, `activePolygon3DCount`, `activePolygon2DCount`, `activePolygonOnTriCount`. Pairs with the existing `triangulationCount` / `polygon3DCount` from v0.133.0.
- Per-entity cache-first queries:
  - `meshFaceActiveTriangulationRepId(_ faceIndex:)` → optional rep id (cache-first, persistent fallback)
  - `meshEdgePolygon3DRepId(_ edgeIndex:)` → optional rep id (cache-first, persistent fallback)
  - `meshCoEdgeHasMesh(_ coedgeIndex:)` → bool (cache-only)

The Swift API is unchanged for existing call sites. Driver: prep for future BRepGraphMesh-driven workflows in OCCTMCP / OCCTSwiftScripts that want to introspect mesh state without invalidating the persistent tier.

The mesh **write** API (`BRepGraph_Tool::Mesh::CreateTriangulationRep` etc.) is intentionally not yet wrapped — it requires marshaling `Handle<Poly_Triangulation>` from Swift, which is a larger lift. Targeted for v0.159 or v1.0.

### v0.157.0 (May 2026) — OCCT 8.0.0 beta1 support (final pre-1.0 release)

xcframework rebuilt against `V8_0_0_beta1`. v1.0.0 will follow on May 7, 2026 pinned to the OCCT 8.0.0 GA tag.

Bridge migrations driven by upstream API churn since rc5:

- **`BRepGraph_BuilderView` removed** ([OCCT #1237](https://github.com/Open-Cascade-SAS/OCCT/pull/1237)) → migrated all 22 mutation entry points to `BRepGraph_EditorView`. Old: `g.Builder().AddVertex(p, t)`; new: `g.Editor().Vertices().Add(p, t)`. Swift API surface unchanged.
- **`NCollection_Vector` deprecated** ([OCCT #1230](https://github.com/Open-Cascade-SAS/OCCT/pull/1230)) → switched 4 internal sites to `NCollection_DynamicArray`, including the `BRepGraph_History::Record` mapping container.
- **`Builder().AppendFlattenedShape` / `AppendFullShape` consolidated** → both now route through the static `BRepGraph_Builder::Add(graph, shape, options)`. The `Flatten` and `CreateAutoProduct` options preserve the pre-beta1 distinction.
- **`Builder().ClearFaceMesh` / `ClearEdgePolygon3D` moved** → now `BRepGraph_Tool::Mesh::ClearFaceCache` / `ClearEdgeCache`. Semantic shift: clears only the new cached-mesh tier, not persistent (STEP-imported) mesh data.
- **`graph.Build(shape, parallel)` removed** → wrapper now calls the static `BRepGraph_Builder::Add(graph, shape, opts)` with `CreateAutoProduct = false` to preserve the historical "no auto Product wrap" behaviour.
- **`graph.RootNodeIds()` → `graph.RootProductIds()`** — root iteration is now Products only.
- **`BRepGraph_Copy::CopyFace` → `CopyNode`** — single-node deep copy now takes any NodeId kind.
- **`Topo().Occurrences().ParentOccurrence` removed** — beta1 model is `Product → Occurrence → Product`; an occurrence has no parent occurrence. Wrapper retained as `-1` sentinel for ABI; will be removed in v1.0.
- **`BRepGraph_ChildExplorer::Current()` returns `BRepGraphInc::NodeInstance`** (was `NodeUsage`); field accessor unchanged.
- **`BRepGraph_Tool::Edge::StartVertex` / `EndVertex` renamed** to `StartVertexId` / `EndVertexId`; return type simplified from a `VertexRef` struct to `BRepGraph_VertexId`.
- **`Topo().Poly().Nb*` moved to `Mesh().Poly().Nb*`** — triangulation/polygon counts live on the new MeshView, paired with the two-tier mesh storage.

New beta1 surface (`BRepGraph_MeshCache`, `BRepGraph_MeshView` read-side, `EditorView` per-entity Ops methods, `BRepGraph_Tool::Mesh` cache-write API) is **deferred to v0.158 / v1.0** — kept v0.157 minimal to preserve the soak window.

The 1300+ existing tests continue to pass under serial execution (`OCCT_SERIAL=1` with `--num-workers 1`); the pre-existing parallel-execution NCollection arm64 race remains the same as v0.156.

### v0.156.3 (Apr 2026) — `Document.node(at:)` warms up the labelId registry (issue #95)

The `Document.node(at:)` lookup added in v0.156.1 returned `nil` on a freshly-loaded STEP document if `rootNodes` hadn't been walked first. Cause: the bridge's labelId-to-`TDF_Label` registry is populated lazily via `registerLabel(...)` calls — `OCCTDocumentLabelIsNull(0)` reports null because `labels[0]` doesn't exist yet. `rootNodes` warms it up because `OCCTDocumentGetRootLabelId(handle, i)` calls `registerLabel`, but `OCCTDocumentGetRootCount` alone doesn't.

`node(at:)` now eagerly iterates root indices to register top-level labels before the IsNull check:

```swift
public func node(at labelId: Int64) -> AssemblyNode? {
    let rootCount = OCCTDocumentGetRootCount(handle)
    for i in 0..<rootCount { _ = OCCTDocumentGetRootLabelId(handle, i) }
    guard !OCCTDocumentLabelIsNull(handle, labelId) else { return nil }
    return AssemblyNode(document: self, labelId: labelId)
}
```

Deep-child labelIds aren't registered by this warmup — those are expected to have been registered earlier by an explicit traversal (e.g. via `node.children`). The contract docstring spells this out.

`mainLabel` was checked for the same lazy-init quirk and is fine as-is — `OCCTDocumentGetMainLabel` calls `registerLabel(main)` itself.

Driver: [OCCTSwiftScripts#23](https://github.com/gsdali/OCCTSwiftScripts/issues/23)'s `set-metadata` verb. The downstream workaround (`_ = document.rootNodes.count` before `node(at:)`) can be removed.

One new regression test: load a STEP doc, look up `node(at: 0)` *without* touching `rootNodes` first, expect a non-nil node with `labelId == 0`.

### v0.156.2 (Apr 2026) — Public `Mesh(vertices:normals:indices:)` constructor (issue #94)

`Mesh` had `internal init(handle:)` and no public way to construct from raw vertex/index arrays. This blocked sibling packages (notably [OCCTSwiftMesh](https://github.com/gsdali/OCCTSwiftMesh)) from returning `Mesh` instances produced by mesh-domain algorithms (decimation, smoothing, repair, remeshing) that operate purely on vertex/index buffers and have no B-Rep state.

```swift
let mesh = Mesh(
    vertices: [SIMD3(0, 0, 0), SIMD3(1, 0, 0), SIMD3(0, 1, 0)],
    indices: [0, 1, 2]
)
```

Optional `normals: [SIMD3<Float>]?` parameter — when nil, per-vertex normals are computed by averaging the face normals of adjacent triangles (smooth shading default). Per-triangle normals are always computed from the geometry. `faceIndices` is set to `-1` for every triangle (no B-Rep source).

Failable initializer rejects: empty inputs, index count not divisible by 3, indices out of range, mismatched normals count.

Bridge: one new symbol `OCCTMeshCreateFromArrays(vertices, vertexCount, normals, indices, indexCount) -> OCCTMeshRef?` — caller releases via the existing `OCCTMeshRelease`. Unblocks [OCCTSwiftMesh#1](https://github.com/gsdali/OCCTSwiftMesh/issues/1) (v0.1.0 — `Mesh.simplified(_:)` via vendored meshoptimizer).

7 new tests covering round-trip, computed-normals correctness, supplied-normals preservation, and all four invalid-input rejection paths.

### v0.156.1 (Apr 2026) — Public `AssemblyNode.labelId` + `Document.node(at:)` lookup (issue #93)

`AssemblyNode.labelId` was `internal` even though every other `Document` API works in terms of `Int64` labelIds (`removeShape(labelId:)`, `componentLabelId(...)`, `expandShape(labelId:)`, etc.). Consumers walking the assembly via `Document.rootNodes → AssemblyNode.children` couldn't read each node's `labelId` to identify it across calls. Driver: [OCCTSwiftScripts#23](https://github.com/gsdali/OCCTSwiftScripts/issues/23) (`occtkit inspect-assembly` / `set-metadata`) needs stable IDs that round-trip.

Two tiny additive changes:

```swift
// 1. labelId is now public
public let labelId: Int64

// 2. New lookup on Document
public func node(at labelId: Int64) -> AssemblyNode?
```

`node(at:)` validates the labelId via `OCCTDocumentLabelIsNull` (O(1), consistent with the rest of the int64-based Document API) and returns `nil` for unknown labelIds. LabelIds are stable within a single `Document` instance — round-trips with `rootNodes` traversal in the same session.

No bridge changes. Two new tests covering the round-trip and rejection of nonexistent labelIds.

### v0.156.0 (Apr 2026) — Quality release: drop deprecated `GCE2d_*` symbols

OCCT 8.0.0 deprecated the entire `GCE2d_Make*` family of 2D geometry constructors in favour of the canonical `GC_Make*2d` names — each old class is now literally a `using GCE2d_X = GC_X2d` typedef alias. This release migrates all internal C++ uses inside `OCCTBridge.mm` to the canonical names so we're no longer building against deprecated identifiers.

```
GCE2d_MakeArcOfCircle   → GC_MakeArcOfCircle2d
GCE2d_MakeArcOfEllipse  → GC_MakeArcOfEllipse2d
GCE2d_MakeArcOfHyperbola → GC_MakeArcOfHyperbola2d
GCE2d_MakeArcOfParabola → GC_MakeArcOfParabola2d
GCE2d_MakeCircle        → GC_MakeCircle2d
GCE2d_MakeEllipse       → GC_MakeEllipse2d
GCE2d_MakeHyperbola     → GC_MakeHyperbola2d
GCE2d_MakeLine          → GC_MakeLine2d
GCE2d_MakeMirror        → GC_MakeMirror2d
GCE2d_MakeParabola      → GC_MakeParabola2d
GCE2d_MakeRotation      → GC_MakeRotation2d
GCE2d_MakeScale         → GC_MakeScale2d
GCE2d_MakeSegment       → GC_MakeSegment2d
GCE2d_MakeTranslation   → GC_MakeTranslation2d
```

14 `#include` directives + ~30 internal symbol uses migrated. Bridge ABI unchanged: the bridge's own C function names (`OCTGCE2dMake*`) are preserved so Swift wrappers continue to call them by their existing names — this is a **non-breaking** internal hygiene release.

Operation count, test count, and suite count are unchanged — same OCCT objects, just constructed via canonical names. The `@Suite("GCE2d_MakeLine")` test label was renamed to `@Suite("GC_MakeLine2d")` for consistency. Source comments and `// MARK:` headers in `Sources/OCCTSwift/Curve2D.swift` and `Sources/OCCTSwift/Document.swift` were updated similarly.

This was the cleanup-half of a rescoped v0.156.0 plan. The OCAF/Message data introspection scope originally pencilled in for v0.156.0 was abandoned after a full audit revealed the project is at the asymptote of useful OCCT public surface — most flagged "missing" classes were already wrapped via the established `OCCTDocumentRef` + `int64_t labelId` pattern, and the genuinely unwrapped classes (~25 ops total: `gp_Vec2f/3f`, `GeomConvert_FuncCone/Cylinder/SphereLSDist`) are too small to justify a 100-op release on their own.

### v0.155.1 (Apr 2026) — `Wire(_:Shape)` convenience initializer (issue #91)

Completes the v0.154.0 trio. Recovers a typed `Wire` from a generic `Shape` that wraps a `TopoDS_Wire`, returning nil on type mismatch. Mirrors `Face(_:Shape)` and `Edge(_:Shape)`.

```swift
let box = Shape.box(width: 10, height: 10, depth: 10)!
let wireShapes = box.subShapes(ofType: .wire)
if let wire = Wire(wireShapes[0]) {
    // typed Wire recovered from a wire-typed Shape
}
```

Unblocks face-rebuild flows where existing inner wires (returned as `[Shape]` from `Shape.wires` or `subShapes(ofType: .wire)`) need to be passed back into `Shape.face(outer:holes:)` — previously those wires were stuck as `Shape` because the `Wire(handle:)` initializer was internal. Concrete motivating case: preserving both bore and chamfer outlines on the same mid-face when extracting countersink mid-surfaces in [UnfoldEngine](https://github.com/gsdali/UnfoldEngine).

Bridge: one new symbol `OCCTWireFromShape(OCCTShapeRef) -> OCCTWireRef?`.

### v0.155.0 (Apr 2026) — `SheetMetal.Builder`: convex bends (issue #89)

The v0.151–v0.153 builder only supported **concave** bends (L-bracket-style, where the two flanges' bodies overlap in volume around the seam). **Convex** bends — Z-section middle bends, offset brackets, gusseted brackets where one flange folds back on the opposite side — failed with `BuildError.filletFailed` because the seam edge is non-manifold (a kiss point with four boundary faces meeting at one line, which `BRepFilletAPI_MakeFillet` rejects).

v0.155 adds first-class convex bend support:

- **Auto-detected direction.** Each bend is classified concave or convex from the relative position of the two flanges' body centroids. No caller change needed; the existing v0.151–v0.153 fixtures (L, U, stepped Z) continue to build identically because they're all concave.

- **Convex bend material.** Convex bends build a **curved-triangle prism** that bridges the two flanges' outer-corner edges with a cylindrical fillet on the outside surface, then boolean-fuses with the flanges. The "kiss point" stays sharp on the inside (which is the natural CAD interpretation when the user's flange placements don't leave room for an inside cylinder); the outside is rounded to the bend radius.

- **`Bend` struct expanded** with optional explicit controls:
  - `angle: Double?` — bend angle in radians, signed (positive = concave, negative = convex). Nil means auto-infer from flange positions. Sign convention follows OCCT's right-hand rule: angles are CCW-positive about the bend axis derived from `cross(fromFlange.normal, toFlange.normal)`, with concave-positive matching how a CAD designer thinks about bends.
  - `insideRadius: Double` — replaces the legacy single `radius` (which still works as a convenience init).
  - `outsideRadius: Double?` — independent control of the outside fillet radius. Defaults to nil = match insideRadius for convex builds.
  - `materialThicknessAtBend: Double?` — allow thinner material in the bend region than the flange thickness, common in etched parts where a thinned bend line allows tighter folds without cracking.
  - `direction: BendDirection` — `.auto` (default), `.concave`, or `.convex` for explicit override.

- **The legacy `Bend(from:to:radius:)` initializer is unchanged.** All v0.151–v0.153 callers continue to work without modification.

The 93-face inside-corner-reinforcing-bracket from #89 (Z-section with both same-direction and convex bends) now builds cleanly. Test fixtures from the issue: symmetric Z, offset L with very short web, channel-with-flange, all pass.

Bridge: one new symbol `OCCTWireCreateArcThroughPoints(s, m, e)` for 3-point arc-wire construction (avoids the `gp_Ax2` X-direction ambiguity of the angle-based arc API). Exposed as `Wire.arc(start:midpoint:end:)`.

### v0.154.0 (Apr 2026) — `Face(_:Shape)` and `Edge(_:Shape)` convenience initializers

Two tiny additive bridge symbols and their Swift conveniences. Recovers a typed `Face` or `Edge` from a generic `Shape` that wraps a `TopoDS_Face` / `TopoDS_Edge` (returns nil on type mismatch). Useful when a method gives back a `Shape` (e.g. `subShapes(ofType: .face)`) and you want the typed wrapper to call methods like `area()`, `outerWire`, `length`, etc., directly.

```swift
let box = Shape.box(width: 10, height: 10, depth: 10)!
let faceShapes = box.subShapes(ofType: .face)
if let face = Face(faceShapes[0]) {
    print(face.area())   // 100
}
```

Bridge: `OCCTFaceFromShape(OCCTShapeRef) -> OCCTFaceRef?` and `OCCTEdgeFromShape(OCCTShapeRef) -> OCCTEdgeRef?`. Both return NULL when the shape's `ShapeType()` doesn't match. Unblocks the upcoming `UnfoldEngine` package, which builds on these.

### v0.153.0 (Apr 2026) — `SheetMetal.Builder` step-aware bends (issue #86)

The v0.151 `SheetMetal.Builder` implementation extruded each flange at its full profile, fused them, then filleted the seam edge. That works when both flanges have matching extents along the seam direction, but fails on **stepped seams** — flanges that meet along less than their full extent (a narrow tab on a wider base, a U-channel with sides narrower than the spine). OCCT can't cleanly fillet an edge that terminates at a free-face boundary, so the v0.151 builder reported `BuildError.filletFailed` and the downstream `OCCTDesignLoop` pipeline padded the narrower flange to match — both expensive and incorrect.

v0.153 lifts that limitation:

- `SheetMetal.Builder.build(flanges:bends:)` now computes the seam intersection between each pair of flanges in a bend and **splits the wider flange** at the intersection endpoints before extruding. The matched-extent middle piece carries the bend; the outer pieces stay flat. The fillet machinery from v0.151 runs unchanged on the matched-extent piece, where it's always well-formed.
- For matched-extent inputs (where v0.151 already worked), the result is identical: the splitting step is a no-op.
- Two new error cases: `BuildError.seamsDoNotOverlap(fromID:toID:)` if the two flanges' seam edges don't actually intersect along the seam line; `BuildError.nonRectangularStepFlange(id:)` if a flange would need to be split but its profile isn't axis-aligned-rectangular (rectangular profiles cover the issue's three test fixtures and the common cases; non-rectangular stepped seams are deferred).

The three reference fixtures from issue #86 all build cleanly:

- **L-bracket** with 80×40 base + 20×30 centred mounting tab.
- **Z-bracket** with 50×30 base + full-seam mid + 20×30 stepped top tab.
- **U-channel** with 100×40 spine + 80×15 stepped side flanges (narrower than the spine in the seam direction).

OCCTDesignLoop's `eval/describer_to_features.py` can drop its seam-padding workaround and emit actual described flange dimensions; the existing typed `SheetMetal.Flange` / `SheetMetal.Bend` API and the JSON envelope are unchanged.

The unrelated v0.151 limitation about the bend axis being on the *outside* corner (sharp inner corner, filleted outer corner) still applies — that's a different construction (real inside-radius + outside-radius bend) and is filed separately.

### v0.152.1 (Apr 2026) — `FeatureReconstructor.buildJSON` decodes `boolean` (issue #88)

`FeatureSpec.boolean` (with `op` ∈ `union | subtract | intersect`, `leftID`, `rightID`) has been wired through `applyBoolean` since the typed Swift API landed, and v0.152's `inputBody` makes it useful for cuts that reference the seeded body via `@input`. But the JSON decoder never picked it up — `FeatureEntry.init(from:)` had no `case "boolean":` branch, so JSON entries with `"kind": "boolean"` fell into the `default:` clause and were silently dropped.

- **Adds the `case "boolean":` decoder branch.** Reads `op` (string), `left`, `right`, optional `id`. Coding keys for these were already declared.
- **Bad `op` rawValue surfaces as a recordable skip** with reason `unsupported("boolean(op:smush)")` rather than throwing — matches the rest of the reconstructor's "graceful degradation" policy.
- **Unknown `kind` strings now also surface as `Skipped` entries** when the JSON entry carries an `id`. Reason: `unsupported("unknown JSON kind: …")`. Stage: `additive`. Without this, typos in `kind` and version-drift schemas were silently swallowed; now they're visible. Entries without an id continue to be silently ignored, matching the rest of `FeatureReconstructor` (the kernel only records skips when there's an id to attach them to).

Together these mean the `inputBody → boolean(@input, slot)` chain that v0.152 implies should work, actually does work end-to-end from JSON.

### v0.152.0 (Apr 2026) — `FeatureReconstructor.inputBody` for chained composition (issue #87)

`FeatureReconstructor.build(from:)` previously always started from an empty `BuildContext.current`, with the in-progress shape grown purely from additive feature entries. That blocks **chaining** — composing a body via one kernel API (e.g. `SheetMetal.Builder` from v0.151) and then cutting / finishing into it via the reconstructor. v0.152 makes the kernel itself accept a starting body.

- **Optional `inputBody` parameter on both build entry points:** `FeatureReconstructor.build(from: specs, inputBody: Shape? = nil)` and `FeatureReconstructor.buildJSON(_:inputBody:)`. When non-nil, `BuildContext.current` is seeded with the input and the input is registered in `namedShapes` under the sentinel id `@input`. When nil, behaviour is byte-for-byte identical to v0.151.
- **`FeatureReconstructor.inputBodySentinel`** — the literal string `@input`, exposed as a public constant so JSON envelopes and Swift callers share one source of truth. Boolean `leftID` / `rightID`, `Fillet.edgeSelector.onFeature`, and `Chamfer.edgeSelector.onFeature` all resolve `@input` via the standard `namedShapes` lookup — no separate code path. Last-write-wins semantics: a feature with `id == "@input"` shadows the seed, which is the obvious behaviour.
- **No JSON schema change.** Downstream callers using `buildJSON` pass `inputBody:` from Swift; the JSON envelope itself is unchanged. Within the envelope, references to `@input` are just regular id strings.
- **Stage ordering preserved.** Additive features still union onto whatever `current` is at the start of stage 1 (input or empty). Subtractive / finishing / annotation stages run with the same dispatch as v0.151. The existing `Skipped` reporting (under-determined / OCCT failure / unresolved-ref / unsupported) is unchanged.

The immediate driver is the sheet-metal → reconstructor chain referenced by [OCCTSwiftScripts#13](https://github.com/gsdali/OCCTSwiftScripts/issues/13): build a bent bracket via `SheetMetal.Builder`, then drill mounting holes into it with the reconstructor's hole-placement and `Skipped` machinery. The verb-side wiring downstream is one line — `FeatureReconstructor.buildJSON(envelope, inputBody: try GraphIO.loadBREP(at: path))`.

This is also the primitive the planned `Skipped` resume-from-last-good-shape behaviour will need: "given a partially-built shape, continue applying remaining specs" reduces to an `inputBody`-aware build.

**Out of scope:** multi-body input lists (use `Shape.compound` upstream), round-tripping face / edge tags from prior history (gone after BREP serialisation), reverse decomposition (`Shape → [FeatureSpec]`).

### v0.151.0 (Apr 2026) — Sheet-metal composition API (issue #85)

OCCT has no sheet-metal bend primitive and is not expected to grow one — CATIA / SolidWorks / FreeCAD all compose bends from extrude + union + fillet. v0.151 adds the canonical Swift-level composition so downstream consumers (OCCTDesignLoop's VLM reconstructor, scripts, MCP tooling) do not each reinvent it.

- **`SheetMetal.Flange`** — a closed 2D profile positioned in world space by explicit `(origin, uAxis, vAxis, normal)`. All three axes are independent so left-handed world placements (e.g. a flange normal along +Y with the profile reading +X / +Z) are expressible without handedness surprises. `vAxis` defaults to `cross(normal, uAxis)` when omitted.
- **`SheetMetal.Bend`** — names two flanges + an inside radius. No geometric data; the builder resolves the seam edge from the flange placements.
- **`SheetMetal.Builder.build(flanges:bends:)`** — extrudes each flange along its normal by `thickness`, fuses the bodies in order, then for each bend finds the seam edge(s) and applies `Shape.filleted(edges:radius:)`. Seam finding walks the fused shape's edges, keeps only those parallel to `cross(nA, nB)`, and selects the one whose midpoint lies on each flange's face that points *toward* the other flange — which uniquely identifies the bend and rejects the coincidental convex back corner.
- **`SheetMetal.BuildError`** — named cases for invalid thickness, empty flange list, duplicate/unknown IDs, invalid profile, extrusion/union/fillet failures, parallel flanges (no seam direction), and missing seam edge. `CustomStringConvertible` for direct logging.

**Known limitation:** stepped seams (flanges meeting along less than their full seam-direction extent, e.g. a narrow upright on a wider base) surface as `BuildError.filletFailed`. OCCT cannot cleanly round an edge that terminates at a free-face boundary; downstream callers should match flange widths along the seam or split the wider flange. Reverse-direction unwrap (bent BRep → flat cutting pattern) is the planned next addition to this namespace.

### v0.150.0 (Apr 2026) — Pure-Swift PDF + SVG export + BOM + balloons

Second half of the v0.149 → v0.150 drawing-automation arc. Drawings now have three readable output formats (DXF for engineering tools, PDF for humans, SVG for the web) plus the assembly-drawing primitives that make BOM-driven output a one-call operation.

- **`PDFWriter` + `Exporter.writePDF(drawing:to:pageSize:)` / `writePDF(sheet:body:to:)`** — pure-Swift PDF 1.4 writer. No UIKit / AppKit / Core Graphics dependency; works on macOS, iOS, and Linux. Helvetica font, one page per file, content stream installs a mm→pts CTM so staged geometry stays in drawing units. Per-layer ISO 128-20 stroke weights (0.5 mm VISIBLE / OUTLINE, 0.25 mm HIDDEN / CENTER / DIMENSION / TEXT, 0.18 mm HATCH) with dashed / chain patterns on HIDDEN / CENTER. Circles rendered as four cubic Bézier segments; arcs split into ≤90° Bézier chunks.
- **`SVGWriter` + `Exporter.writeSVG(drawing:to:)` / `writeSVG(sheet:body:to:)`** — pure-Swift SVG 1.1 writer. One `<g>` group per layer with stroke / stroke-width / stroke-dasharray attributes. Arcs emitted as native SVG `<path d="M… A …"/>`. ViewBox explicit or computed from content bounds. Drawing's mathematical Y (up) mapped to SVG's screen Y (down) via a group-level `scale(1,-1)`; each `<text>` carries its own counter-transform so glyphs read right-side up.
- **`DrawingAnnotation.balloon(Balloon)`** — new case carrying `itemNumber` + `centre` + `radius` + optional `leaderTo`. Rendered in every writer (DXF / PDF / SVG) as a circle + number text + optional leader line that exits the circle at the point nearest the target. `Drawing.addBalloon(itemNumber:at:leaderTo:radius:id:)` is the convenience entry point.
- **`BillOfMaterials`** — pure-Swift `Codable` value type. Seven-column table (ITEM / PART NO / DESCRIPTION / QTY / MAT / MASS / NOTES) with per-column default widths; caller populates `[Item]` and calls `render(into: DXFWriter, at:)`. Origin is the **bottom-right** anchor so the table grows up and to the left (idiomatic placement above a title block). `Sheet.renderBOM(_:into:at:)` convenience places the BOM right-aligned to the inner frame's top edge.
- **`DrawingDispatch.swift`** — shared internal annotation + dimension dispatcher used by `PDFWriter` and `SVGWriter`. `DrawingPrimitiveOps` struct bundles the five drawing primitives (addLine / addPolyline / addCircle / addArc / addText) as closures; a single dispatch path handles every `DrawingAnnotation` case (centreline, centermark, textLabel, hatch, cuttingPlaneLine, balloon) and every `DrawingDimension` case including tolerance rendering. `DXFWriter` continues to use its own inline logic — not because it couldn't be ported, but to keep its test coverage load-bearing and avoid regression risk.
- **`Exporter.pdfA3Landscape` / `pdfA4Landscape`** — named pts-space page-size constants. Also `PDFWriter.addDimension(_:)` / `SVGWriter.addDimension(_:)` mirror the DXF-side method added in v0.149 for ad-hoc dimension staging without a `Drawing`.

After v0.150, the only substantive drawing-layer gap is native DXF `DIMENSION` entities (still exploded LINE+TEXT), which remains demand-gated.

### v0.149.0 (Apr 2026) — Sheet automation + tolerance + ordinate dimensioning

First of a two-release arc closing the last substantive drawing-automation gaps: one-call multi-view layout, typed tolerance data on every dimension, and ISO 129-1 §9.3 ordinate dimensioning.

- **`Sheet.standardLayout(of:scale:margin:includeIso:)`** — composes front / top / side / optional isometric views of a `Shape` onto the sheet's inner frame as a 2x2 grid. Arrangement follows the sheet's `ProjectionAngle`: first-angle places top below front, third-angle places top above. Uniform scale is computed to fit the widest projected view; callers can pass a smaller `DrawingScale` to override. Returns a `StandardLayout` whose `PlacedView`s hold the original Drawings (attach dimensions per view before calling `render(into:)`).
- **`Drawing.addAutoDimensions(from:viewDirection:minRadius:dimensionOffset:bounds:)`** — heuristic dimensioner: adds a linear dimension for the projected X and Y extents of the shape's bounding box, plus a diameter dimension on every visible circular edge. Edge-on circles are skipped (mirrors the `addAutoCentermarks` detection); `minRadius` filters noise holes.
- **`DrawingTolerance`** — typed, `Codable` enum carried as `tolerance: DrawingTolerance` on every `DrawingDimension` payload (Linear, Radial, Diameter, Angular, Ordinate). Cases: `.none`, `.symmetric(Double)`, `.bilateral(plus:minus:)`, `.unilateral(Double)`, `.fitClass(String)`, `.limits(lower:upper:)`. Inline cases fold into the nominal label; multi-value cases render as stacked upper/lower TEXT in DXF at ~55% height, placed perpendicular to each dimension's text baseline.
- **`DrawingDimension.ordinate(Ordinate)`** — shared-origin X+Y dimensioning for CNC reference-datum workflows. Each feature carries its own position plus optional custom label; a single `tolerance` applies across all features. DXF emit draws a small origin cross, per-feature extension lines with ticks at the origin baseline, and offset labels perpendicular to each line. `Drawing.addOrdinateDimensions(origin:features:tolerance:id:)` is the convenience entry point. `DrawingDimension.Ordinate` + `Feature` are `Codable` for JSON-driven pipelines.
- **`DXFWriter.addDimension(_:)`** — public single-entity dispatch over every `DrawingDimension` case; useful for tests and for scripts that compose DXFs from dimension values without going through a `Drawing`.

### v0.148.0 (Apr 2026) — Drawing.append(_:) unified dispatcher

Small release closing #83 and #84 — both asked for the same thing: a public `Drawing.append(_:)` that dispatches every `DrawingAnnotation` case without the consumer-side switch blind spot.

- **`Drawing.append(_ annotation: DrawingAnnotation)`** — appends any `DrawingAnnotation` case (centreline, centermark, textLabel, hatch, cuttingPlaneLine). When new cases land, the dispatcher updates in one place, not in every consumer.
- **`Drawing.append(contentsOf: [DrawingAnnotation])`** — for factory output like `DrawingAnnotation.surfaceFinish(...)`, `.featureControlFrame(...)`, `.datumFeature(...)`, `.breakLine(...)`, `.cosmeticThreadSideView(...)` which all return arrays.
- **`Drawing.append(_ dimension: DrawingDimension)`** / `append(contentsOf: [DrawingDimension])` — symmetric for dimensions.

Downstream `replay(...)` helpers (OCCTSwiftScripts, OCCTSwiftPartsAgent) collapse to one-line `drawing.append(contentsOf: DrawingAnnotation.surfaceFinish(...))`. The existing `addCentreLine` / `addCentermark` / `addTextLabel` / `addHatch` / `addCuttingPlaneLine` typed factories continue to work unchanged; they're now a thin convenience over `append(_:)` conceptually (though the storage path is identical either way).

### v0.147.0 (Apr 2026) — Drawing + FeatureSpec consumer polish

Closes four small follow-up issues (#79, #80, #81, #82) that downstream consumers (OCCTSwiftScripts, OCCTDesignLoop, MCP tooling) asked for to remove boilerplate and unblock JSON-driven workflows.

- **#80 `Edge.curve3D`**: Direct `Edge → Curve3D` bridge. Ensures the 3D curve is built via `BRepLib::BuildCurves3d` for pcurve-only edges. Returns the raw `Geom_Curve` so consumers can call `curve.circleProperties` / `lineProperties` / etc. without DownCast gymnastics.
- **#79 `Drawing.addAutoCentermarks(from:viewDirection:extent:minRadius:bounds:)`**: symmetric to `addAutoCentrelines`. Walks circular edges, projects each centre into the view plane, adds `.centermark` annotations. Skips edges whose circle plane is parallel to the view (edge-on). `minRadius` filters small holes; `bounds` filters centermarks outside the view.
- **#81 `DrawingAnnotation.CuttingPlaneLine` + `Drawing.addCuttingPlaneLine`**: typed ISO 128-40 cutting-plane line. Computes trace in view 2D from cutting plane normal × view direction. DXFWriter renders heavy-chain ends, thin-chain middle, perpendicular arrows, and label letters at both ends.
- **#82 `FeatureSpec` Codable conformance**: `FeatureSpec` + all nested types (`Revolve`, `Extrude`, `Hole`, `Thread`, `EdgeSelector`, `Fillet`, `Chamfer`, `Boolean`) now `Codable`. Unblocks `FeatureReconstructor.buildJSON` + Python / MCP driven reconstruction pipelines without each consumer mirroring the types in their own schema.

### v0.146.0 (Apr 2026) — ISO drawings III: cosmetic threads, surface finish, GD&T symbols, detail views

Closes the ISO drawings arc (#78). Final release ships cosmetic threads (#77), ISO 1302 surface finish, ISO 1101 GD&T symbols, and compressed-view conventions (detail + break lines).

- **#77 `DrawingAnnotation.cosmeticThreadSideView` / `cosmeticThreadEndView`**: ISO 6410 cosmetic thread representation. Side view: two parallel lines at minor diameter spanning the thread length, optional callout text. End view: 3/4 broken arc set (0–90° / 90–180° / 180–315° with a 45° gap). `Drawing.addCosmeticThreadSide(...)` and `DXFWriter.addCosmeticThreadEndView(...)` convenience wrappers.
- **ISO 1302 surface finish**: `SurfaceFinishSymbol` enum (`.any` / `.machiningRequired` / `.machiningProhibited`). `DrawingAnnotation.surfaceFinish(at:leaderTo:ra:symbol:method:)` produces the check-mark geometry with Ra value label, horizontal bar for machiningRequired, optional production-method text, and leader line to the target feature.
- **ISO 1101 GD&T symbols**: `GDTSymbol` enum covering all 15 ASME/ISO geometric characteristics (straightness, flatness, circularity, cylindricity, profile of line/surface, perpendicularity, parallelism, angularity, position, concentricity, symmetry, coaxiality, circular runout, total runout). `DrawingAnnotation.featureControlFrame(at:symbol:tolerance:datums:leaderTo:)` emits the classic `[⌖] [0.1] [A] [B] [C]` rectangular frame. `DrawingAnnotation.datumFeature(label:at:pointingTo:)` emits the boxed letter + triangle pointer.
- **Detail views**: `Drawing.detailView(at:scale:)` returns a `TransformedDrawing` suitable for placing a scaled-up region of the parent drawing at a specific sheet location.
- **Break lines**: `DrawingAnnotation.breakLine(from:to:amplitude:)` emits ISO 128-30 compressed-length zigzag marker as 5 line segments.

### v0.145.0 (Apr 2026) — ISO drawings II: sheet templates, title blocks, projection symbols

Second release in the ISO drawings arc (#78). Closes #76 — adds ISO 5457 trimmed-sheet templates, ISO 7200 title blocks, and ISO 5456-2 projection symbols as first-class OCCTSwift API.

- **`PaperSize`**: `A0` / `A1` / `A2` / `A3` / `A4` with `.size(in: .landscape)` / `.portrait` returning ISO 5457 trimmed dimensions in mm.
- **`Orientation`**: `.landscape` / `.portrait`.
- **`ProjectionAngle`**: `.first` (ISO / Europe) / `.third` (ANSI / USA).
- **`TitleBlock`**: ISO 7200 mandatory + optional fields (title, drawingNumber, owner, creator, approver, documentType, dateOfIssue, revision, sheetNumber, language, material, weight, scale).
- **`Sheet`**: ties PaperSize + Orientation + ProjectionAngle + TitleBlock together. `render(into: DXFWriter)` emits border + ISO 5457 inner frame with correct margins (20 mm binding left, 10 mm other edges on A0–A3), centring marks at edge midpoints, and the title block in the bottom-right. `innerFrame` property exposes the drawable rectangle for layout.
- **`ProjectionSymbol`**: `ProjectionSymbol.render(.first, at:, into:)` emits the ISO 5456-2 truncated-cone + circle pair at the correct relative position for first / third angle.
- DXFWriter gets two new layers: `BORDER` and `TITLE`.

### v0.144.0 (Apr 2026) — ISO drawings I: section views, hatch, multi-view, style foundations

First of a three-release ISO-drawings arc (tracked in #78). Closes #73, #74, #75 and adds the ISO 128-20 / 3098 / 5455 style primitives every downstream sheet producer needs.

- **#75 `Drawing.transformed(translate:scale:)` + `Drawing.bounds`**: new `TransformedDrawing` wrapper and `DXFWriter.collectFromDrawing(_ transformed:)` overload. `Drawing.bounds(deflection:includeAnnotations:)` returns the drawing's 2D axis-aligned bounding box. Unblocks multi-view sheet composition: `writer.collectFromDrawing(view.transformed(translate: offset, scale: 0.5))`.
- **#73 `Shape.section2D(planeOrigin:planeNormal:planeU:deflection:)`** + `Shape.section2DView(...)`: slice a shape with a plane, return a `Drawing` in the plane's own 2D frame (not world space). `section2DView` wraps the contour with automatic ISO 128-40 hatching at 45° and an optional "A-A" label.
- **#74 `Drawing.addHatch(boundary:angle:spacing:islands:)`**: ISO 128-50 sectional-view fill. DXFWriter tessellates into line segments at the specified angle and spacing with island (hole) subtraction via even-odd rule scanlines. Adds `HATCH` + `SECTION` XCAF layers.
- **G1 ISO 128-20 line widths + ISO 128-21 arrows + ISO 3098 text heights**: `DrawingLineWidth` enum (w013 → w200, ISO 1:1.4 series), `DrawingTextHeight` enum (h25 → h200) with `.recommended(forPaper:)` and `.snap(_:)`, `DrawingArrowStyle` (filledClosed / openClosed90 / openClosed30 / tick), `DrawingLineStyle.defaultWidth` / `.boldWidth` per style.
- **G2 ISO 5455 `DrawingScale`**: enum cases `.one` / `.reduction(Int)` / `.enlargement(Int)` / `.custom(Double)` with `.factor` and `.label` accessors. `DrawingScale.preferred` returns the ISO-standard scale series (50:1 down to 1:1000).

### v0.143.0 (Apr 2026) — Measurement ergonomics + clearing v0.142 deferrals

Small-but-broad release that sands the measurement papercuts surfaced by the v0.143 audit and retires every deferral the v0.142 release notes flagged. Roughly 40 ops: 4 measurement additions, 5 deferral clearings.

**Measurement ergonomics (M1–M4):**

- **`Shape.volume` / `Shape.surfaceArea`** — verified already wrapped as optional properties (audit had missed them); no new code, just confirmation.
- **`Curve3D.distance(to: SIMD3)` / `Edge.distance(to: SIMD3)`** — one-liner point-to-curve distance when you don't need the projected point / parameter.
- **Angle helpers**: `Edge.angle(to:)`, `Edge.isParallel(to:tolerance:)`, `Edge.isPerpendicular(to:tolerance:)`, `Face.angle(to:)`, `Face.isParallel(to:)`, `Face.isPerpendicular(to:)`, `Face.isCoplanar(with:tolerance:)`. Plus `ConstructionAxis.angle(to:in:)`, `ConstructionPlane.angle(to:in:)`. `unsignedAngle(between:and:)` free function for SIMD3 pairs.
- **Circle / revolution property extraction**: `Edge.circleProperties` returns `(center, radius, axis, isFullCircle, startAngle, endAngle)?` for circular edges (three-point circle fit). `Face.revolutionProperties` returns `(axis, radius)?` for cylindrical / conical / spherical / toroidal / surface-of-revolution faces.

**Deferral clearings (from v0.142 release notes):**

- **Constructionspeak persistence (D1)**: `Document.addConstructionShape(_:)` tags a shape with the `CONSTRUCTION` XCAF layer; `Document.constructionShapeLabels` enumerates on reload. `ConstructionContext.materialize(in:graph:options:)` resolves every plane/axis/point recipe and creates a finite representative shape (rectangular face for planes, bounded edge for axes, vertex for points) on the layer. STEP export preserves layer tags; import produces layer-marked shapes but not the typed recipes. Matches FreeCAD's long-standing ceiling.
- **Arc / circle tessellation in `Sketch.buildProfile` (D2)**: `SketchElement.CurveKind.tessellate2D(segmentsPerRadian:)` for all four curve kinds (line / polyline / arc / circle). `Sketch.buildProfile` now lifts tessellated samples through the host plane's frame. D-shaped and circular profiles now produce wires.
- **Named-shape registry for `FeatureSpec.Boolean` (D3)**: Each feature with a non-nil `id` registers its produced shape in an internal dict; `Boolean.leftID` / `rightID` look up by id. `.union` / `.subtract` / `.intersect` all supported. Missing-id cases report `.unresolvedRef`.
- **Multi-leaf `.createdBy` disambiguation (D4)**: new `leafOccurrence: Int? = 0` parameter on `TopologyRef.createdBy` — pick the Nth leaf when a creation has split into multiple live descendants. `TopologyGraph.currentForms(of:)` returns all leaves. `leafOccurrence: nil` disables forward-walk.
- **FeatureReconstructor ↔ TopologyGraph coupling for `EdgeSelector` (D5)**: `.nearPoint(point, tolerance)` resolves edges by midpoint-distance within the target shape. `.onFeature(featureID)` looks up the source feature's shape via the named-shape registry and heuristically matches target edges whose midpoints coincide with the source's edges. `.all` for uniform fillet/chamfer still works. (v1 heuristic; full graph-history dispatch remains available if consumers need per-op edge identity.)

Scope cuts: chamfer per-edge selector still requires a per-edge distance array the bridge doesn't yet expose — falls through to `.unsupported` for `.nearPoint` / `.onFeature` on chamfer specifically. Uniform chamfer (`.all`) works. Flagged as a v0.144 candidate.

### v0.142.0 (Apr 2026) — Construction geometry, sketches, FeatureReconstructor

Second release in the v0.141 → v0.143 arc — ships Phases 2–6 from #72 plus #62 in one go. With this release, OCCTSwift has the full construction-geometry vocabulary that agentic modelling needs: recipe-based references (v0.141) → typed construction entities → document context → sketches → declarative feature reconstruction.

- **`ConstructionPlane` / `ConstructionAxis` / `ConstructionPoint`** (#72 Phase 2): Fusion-style recipe enums carrying `TopologyRef`s. 7 plane variants (absolute, offsetFromFace, throughAxis, tangentToFace, midPlane, byThreePoints, normalToEdge), 5 axis variants (absolute, alongEdge, normalToFace, throughPoints, intersectionOfPlanes), 6 point variants (absolute, atVertex, midpointOfEdge, centroidOfFace, atEdgeParameter, intersectionOfAxisAndPlane). Resolvers compute `Placement` / `(origin, direction)` / `SIMD3<Double>` against a `TopologyGraph`. Typed `ConstructionResolutionError`.
- **`TopologyRef.containedIn` now resolves** (#72 Phase 2 unblock): new `OCCTBRepGraphChildIndices` bridge + `TopologyGraph.childIndices(rootKind:rootIndex:targetKind:)` Swift wrapper.
- **`ConstructionContext`** (#72 Phase 3): Document-level collection with typed opaque IDs (`PlaneID` / `AxisID` / `PointID`), named entities, per-entity resolution against a graph, and `allBroken(in:)` diagnostic returning every entity that fails to resolve. `Document.constructionContext` is a lazy per-document property.
- **`Sketch` + `SketchElement`** (#72 Phase 4): `Sketch` is hosted on a `ConstructionPlane` ID, carries an array of `SketchElement`s with per-element `isConstruction` flag. `buildProfile(in:graph:)` is the **single filter site** (FreeCAD-inspired) — construction elements are excluded when assembling the profile wire. Elements: `.line`, `.polyline`, `.arc`, `.circle` (arcs/circles tessellation comes later).
- **`FeatureReconstructor`** (#62): Declarative `FeatureSpec` tagged union (revolve / extrude / hole / thread / fillet / chamfer / boolean). `FeatureReconstructor.build(from:)` with staged additive → subtractive → finishing → annotation dispatch. `EdgeSelector` enum with `.all`, `.nearPoint`, `.onFeature` — `.onFeature` currently reports `.unsupported` pending full TopologyGraph-integrated dispatcher; `.all` works today for uniform fillet/chamfer. `FeatureReconstructor.buildJSON(_:)` front end parses the OCCTDesignLoop-compatible schema.
- **`Placement`** shared value type (origin + orthonormal basis) with ergonomic `init(origin:normal:)` that picks deterministic x/y axes.

Scope of what the v1 implementation deliberately does **not** do (deferred to later iterations as concrete consumers surface):
- Constraint solving in `Sketch` — explicit non-goal (see #72).
- Named-shape registry for `FeatureSpec.Boolean` with id-based left/right selection.
- `.onFeature` / `.nearPoint` edge resolution in fillet/chamfer dispatch — requires coupling `FeatureReconstructor` to a live `TopologyGraph`, which is the natural next iteration once agents drive it.
- XCAF `CONSTRUCTION` layer persistence — recipes live in-memory; STEP round-trip drops them (matches FreeCAD's 20-year limitation documented in #72).
- Multi-leaf `.createdBy` disambiguation when a single creation splits into many live descendants.

### v0.141.0 (Apr 2026) — Construction-geometry foundation: BRepGraph history readback + TopologyRef

First release in the v0.141 → v0.143 "Construction Geometry" arc (tracked in #72). Builds the substrate for recipe-based topology references that survive mutations — the prerequisite for agent-driven CAD where construction planes / axes / points stay attached to model features through edits.

- **BRepGraph history record readback (#72 Phase 0)**: Exposes the old→new node mappings that the OCCT kernel was already recording. `TopologyGraph.historyRecord(at:)`, `.historyRecords`, `.findOriginal(of:)`, `.findDerived(of:)`, `.recordHistory(operationName:original:replacements:)`. New `TopologyGraph.NodeRef` value type (kind + index) and `HistoryRecord` with full mapping.
- **`TopologyRef` recipe type (#72 Phase 1)**: Indirect enum expressing topology references as *recipes evaluated against the current graph*, not as indices (Onshape FeatureScript-inspired). Cases: `.literal(NodeRef)`, `.createdBy(operationName:kind:occurrence:)`, `.containedIn(parent:kind:occurrence:)`, `.splitOf(original:occurrence:)`. Typed `TopologyResolutionError` enum for failure modes.
- **`TopologyGraph.resolve(_:)`**: Evaluates recipes by walking history records, returns `Result<NodeRef, TopologyResolutionError>`. `.createdBy` picks up newly-introduced replacements by operation name and walks forward to the current form; `.splitOf` picks the Nth replacement of a split original; ancestor-resolution failures surface as `.ancestorMissing`.

Scope: `.containedIn` returns `.noCurrentDescendant` until Phase 2 adds child-at-index accessors. `.createdBy` current-form walk picks the first leaf in deterministic order; multi-leaf disambiguation (useful when a single creation splits into many live descendants) comes in later phases.

### v0.140.0 (Apr 2026) — GD&T write path + typed dimension/tolerance enums

Completes the read-only GD&T support shipped in v0.21.0 with a write path. Downstream callers can now author `XCAFDoc_Dimension` / `XCAFDoc_GeomTolerance` / `XCAFDoc_Datum` attributes, attach them to shape labels, and round-trip through STEP AP242. Typed Swift enums replace the raw `Int32` type codes from v0.21.0 for the full list of XCAFDimTolObjects types.

- **Typed enums**: `Document.DimensionType` (all 32 `XCAFDimTolObjects_DimensionType` cases — Location_Linear, Size_Diameter, Size_Radius, toroidal variants, etc.) and `Document.GeomToleranceType` (all 16 — flatness, perpendicularity, position, profileOfLine, etc.).
- **Typed value types**: `Document.Dimension`, `Document.GeomTolerance`, `Document.Datum`. Accessors: `typedDimension(at:)`, `typedGeomTolerance(at:)`, `typedDatum(at:)`, `typedDimensions`, `typedGeomTolerances`, `typedDatums`.
- **Write path**: `Document.createDimension(on:type:value:lowerTolerance:upperTolerance:)`, `createGeomTolerance(on:type:value:)`, `createDatum(name:)`, `setDimensionTolerance(at:lower:upper:)`. Returns the new attribute's index or nil on failure.
- **Bridge additions**: `OCCTDocumentCreateDimension`, `OCCTDocumentCreateGeomTolerance`, `OCCTDocumentCreateDatum`, `OCCTDocumentSetDimensionTolerance`.

Scope: full modifier / qualifier / grade sequences (`XCAFDimTolObjects_DimensionModif`, `GeomToleranceModif`, `DatumSingleModif` etc.) remain partial wrapping — added on demand. This release covers the 90%-case authoring path.

### v0.139.0 (Apr 2026) — Thread Form v2 + cleanup

Replaces v0.138's circular-sweep thread placeholder with a real truncated V-profile following ISO-68 / UN conventions. Also folds in two quality-of-life cleanups (#68 boolean arg labels, #69 versioned MARK headers).

**Behaviour change**: callers of v0.138's `Shape.threadedHole` / `threadedShaft` will now receive geometry that actually looks like a thread in HLR reprojection (alternating diagonal edges at pitch spacing) rather than a helical groove. API signatures unchanged; new default parameters (`starts: 1`, `runout: .none`) preserve single-start no-runout behaviour.

- **Thread Form v2 (#66 follow-up)**: `ThreadCutterProfile` builds a truncated trapezoidal cross-section with 30° flanks (60° included), H/8 crest flat, H/4 root flat. Swept along a helical spine with `BRepOffsetAPI_MakePipeShell` (correctedFrenet mode) and boolean-cut against the target. New `crestFlat` / `rootFlat` / `minorDiameter` accessors on `ThreadSpec`. New `RunoutStyle` enum (`.none` / `.filleted(radius:)` / `.tapered(turns:)`). New `starts: Int` parameter on `threadedHole` / `threadedShaft` for multi-start threads.
- **Boolean op labels (#68)**: `Shape.union(_:)`, `Shape.intersection(_:)`, `Shape.section(_:)` now match `Shape.subtracting(_:)` — all unlabelled, consistent with `Set.union(_:)` / `Set.intersection(_:)`. Deprecated `with:`-labelled shims kept for backwards compatibility.
- **MARK header refactor (#69)**: 32 versioned grab-bag MARK headers (`// MARK: - v0.X.Y: A, B, C`) renamed to feature-first format (`// MARK: - A, B, C (v0.X.Y)`). Xcode jump-to-section and grep-for-feature now work; OCCTMCP's MARK-based API-reference generator can categorise without a regex fallback.

Tapered-runout law-based pipe-shell is tracked as a follow-up — the `.tapered` case falls back to `.filleted` until `BRepOffsetAPI_MakePipeShell::SetLaw` is wrapped.

### v0.138.0 (Apr 2026) — Engineering Drawings II: DXF export + thread features

Second release in the v0.137 → v0.139 arc. Closes #63 (DXF export) and #66 (ISO thread features). ~50 ops.

- **DXF 2D writer (#63)**: Custom pure-Swift DXF R12 ASCII writer (OCCT ships no DXF support — confirmed by audit). `Exporter.writeDXF(drawing:to:deflection:)` walks a `Drawing`'s visible / hidden / outline edges through `Shape.allEdgePolylines` and emits LINE / LWPOLYLINE / CIRCLE / ARC / TEXT entities. Layers: VISIBLE / HIDDEN / OUTLINE / CENTER / DIMENSION / TEXT, with appropriate linetypes (CONTINUOUS / DASHED / CHAIN). Dimensions from v0.137's `DrawingDimension` are emitted as exploded LINE+TEXT geometry (universally readable). `Exporter.writeDXF(shape:to:viewDirection:)` convenience combines projection and write. Public `DXFWriter` for callers composing DXF manually.
- **Thread features (#66)**: `ThreadForm` enum (iso68 / unified); `ThreadSpec` struct with `parse("M5x0.8")`, `parse("1/4-20 UNC")`, metric-coarse-pitch table, theoretical and cut depth accessors, minor-diameter computation. `Shape.threadedHole(axisOrigin:axisDirection:spec:depth:)` and `Shape.threadedShaft(axisOrigin:axisDirection:spec:length:)` produce helical cut / boss geometry via `BRepOffsetAPI_MakePipeShell` sweep of a circular profile. Integrates with #62's `FeatureReconstructor` — `FeatureSpec.Thread` can now route through real geometry instead of annotation-only.

Scope decisions: v1 threads use a circular sweep cross-section rather than full 60° flank triangle — produces correct handedness, pitch, diameter, and depth for reprojection diff and visualisation; manufacturing-accurate flanks land in a follow-up release. Multi-start threads, ACME / BSP / NPT forms, and full BRepOffsetAPI_MakePipeShell option wrapping (SetForceApproxC1, multi-profile Add()) deferred. GLTF Shape-level export, PLY import, STEP/IGES option completeness dropped from v0.138 — Document-level GLTF already ships, and the remaining gaps are low priority vs. closed-loop pipeline needs.

### v0.137.0 (Apr 2026) — Engineering Drawings I: axes, dimensions, centrelines

Keystone release for the v0.137 → v0.139 "Engineering Drawings" series (tracked in #67). Adds axis extraction from shapes (#65), a pure-Swift value-type dimensioning API on `Drawing` (#64), and auto-centreline generation bridging the two. ~60 ops.

- **Axis extraction (#65)**: `Face.primaryAxis`, `Shape.revolutionAxes(tolerance:)`, `Shape.symmetryAxes(fractionalTolerance:)`, `Surface.torusAxis`, `Surface.revolutionAxis`. New `ShapeAxis` value type with `.cylinder`/`.cone`/`.sphere`/`.torus`/`.revolution`/`.extrusion`/`.symmetry` kinds. Bridge: `OCCTSurfaceTorusAxis`, `OCCTSurfaceRevolutionAxis`, `OCCTSurfaceRevolutionLocation`, `OCCTFaceGetPrimaryAxis`, `OCCTShapeRevolutionAxes`, `OCCTShapeSymmetryAxes`.
- **Surface introspection completeness**: typed `Surface.SurfaceType` + `Surface.surfaceKind`; `Surface.Continuity` + `Surface.continuityClass`; type-predicate conveniences `isPlane` / `isCylinder` / `isCone` / `isSphere` / `isTorus` / `isBezier` / `isBSpline` / `isSurfaceOfRevolution` / `isSurfaceOfExtrusion` / `isOffsetSurface`.
- **Drawing dimensioning API (#64)**: `DrawingDimension` tagged union (linear / radial / diameter / angular) + `DrawingAnnotation` tagged union (centreline / centremark / text label). `DrawingLineStyle` enum. Methods on `Drawing`: `addLinearDimension`, `addRadialDimension`, `addDiameterDimension`, `addAngularDimension`, `addCentreLine`, `addCentermark`, `addTextLabel`, `clearAnnotations`, plus `dimensions` / `annotations` accessors. Pure-Swift value types — XDE round-trip deferred to v0.139 (#67).
- **Auto-centreline generation (#64 ↔ #65)**: `Drawing.addAutoCentrelines(from:viewDirection:overshoot:tolerance:bounds:)` projects a shape's revolution axes into the drawing's view plane and emits chain-pattern centrelines; axes parallel to the view direction are returned in `.skipped`.

Scope decisions (see #67 for rationale): Full PrsDim display-dimension completeness (MaxRadius / MinRadius / Chamf2d / Chamf3d) and PrsDim geometric-relation wrapping (Concentric / Parallel / etc.) were cut from v0.137 — they are AIS display objects with low marginal value compared to the Swift value-type API that drives the closed-loop drawing workflow.
