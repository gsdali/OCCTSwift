//  Thread safety utilities for OCCT operations.
//
//  OCCT is not thread-safe for concurrent access to shared geometry.
//  BSpline adaptor caches, topology mutations, and various algorithms
//  have data races when called from multiple threads simultaneously.
//
//  Use `OCCTSerial.withLock { }` around any sequence of OCCT operations
//  that must be atomic. Individual bridge calls are NOT auto-locked —
//  the lock is provided for users who need to protect multi-step
//  workflows from concurrent access.
//
//  For parallel geometry workflows, use `Shape.deepCopy()` to create
//  independent shape graphs that can be safely processed on separate threads.
