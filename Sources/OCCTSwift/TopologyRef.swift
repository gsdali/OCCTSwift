// MARK: - TopologyRef — references as recipes, not indices (#72 Phase 1)
//
// OCCT's TopoDS_Shape / BRepGraph NodeId is an index. After any mutation the
// index may refer to a different node, a deleted slot, or nothing at all. For
// agent-driven CAD where operations compose freely, this is unworkable: the
// agent would have to re-infer identity after every step.
//
// Following Onshape's FeatureScript design ("qCreatedBy", "qSplitBy", etc.),
// a TopologyRef is a *recipe* — the instructions for finding an entity — and
// resolution re-evaluates the recipe against the current graph state. When the
// recipe can't resolve, we surface the error rather than silently picking a
// plausible guess (Shapr3D / Onshape consensus).
//
// v1 scope: `.literal`, `.createdBy`, `.containedIn`, `.splitOf`. `.adjacentTo`
// and `.offsetFrom` are for ConstructionEntity (Phase 2) and don't belong here.
