/// ```swift
/// // Hatch a rectangle with horizontal lines spaced 2mm apart
/// let boundary: [SIMD2<Double>] = [
///     SIMD2(0, 0), SIMD2(10, 0), SIMD2(10, 5), SIMD2(0, 5)
/// ]
/// let segments = HatchPattern.generate(
///     boundary: boundary,
///     direction: SIMD2(1, 0),
///     spacing: 2.0
/// )
/// ```
