// MARK: - Sketch (#72 Phase 4)
//
// A sketch is a collection of 2D curves hosted on a ConstructionPlane, plus a
// `buildProfile` step that filters out construction elements and produces a
// closed `Wire` in 3D (on the host plane).
//
// This is the filter site matching FreeCAD's `SketchObject::buildShape`: the
// solver / editor sees all elements including construction, but `buildProfile`
// excludes construction before any pad / pocket / revolve downstream.
//
// Constraint solving is explicitly out of scope (see #72 non-goals and the
// SwiftGCS private package). Elements carry coordinates; they don't carry
// constraints, and `buildProfile` does not attempt to satisfy any.
