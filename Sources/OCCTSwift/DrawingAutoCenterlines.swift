    ///     both ends of the projected axis. Default 5.
    ///   - tolerance: Axis-deduplication tolerance passed to `Shape.revolutionAxes`.
    ///   - bounds: Optional override for the 2D bounding box used for clipping. When nil,
    ///     falls back to a sensible default (±1000 square centred at origin) — the caller
    ///     should pass the drawing's actual bbox when it's known.
