A comprehensive Swift wrapper for [OpenCASCADE Technology (OCCT)](https://www.opencascade.com/) 8.0.0, providing B-Rep solid modeling for macOS and iOS. **v1.0.0 — SemVer-stable as of 2026-05-07.**

**4,284 wrapped operations** | macOS 12+ / iOS 15+ / visionOS 1+ / tvOS 15+ (arm64) | OCCT 8.0.0

## Quick Start

### Installation

Add to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/gsdali/OCCTSwift.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

The package ships a pre-built `OCCT.xcframework` as a release asset, so no source build of OCCT is required for end users.

### Usage

```swift
import OCCTSwift

// Primitives
let box = Shape.box(width: 10, height: 5, depth: 3)
let cylinder = Shape.cylinder(radius: 2, height: 10)

// Boolean operations
let result = box - cylinder      // subtract
let combined = box + cylinder    // union
let common = box & cylinder      // intersect

// Modifications
let filleted = result.filleted(radius: 0.5)
let shelled = filleted.shelled(thickness: -0.3)

// Export
try Exporter.writeSTEP(shape: shelled, to: stepURL)
try Exporter.writeSTL(shape: shelled, to: stlURL, deflection: 0.05)
```

## Ecosystem

OCCTSwift is the kernel of a layered family of packages, all SemVer-stable from v1.0.0 (OCCT 8.0.0 GA cohort, May 2026). See [`docs/ecosystem.md`](docs/ecosystem.md) for an architecture map and "when to use which" guidance.

| Package | Role |
|---------|------|
| **OCCTSwift** (this repo) | Core Swift wrapper — shapes, curves, surfaces, OCAF, TopologyGraph, drawing/projection, ML samplers. Bundles the OCCT 8.0.0 GA xcframework. |
| [OCCTSwiftIO](https://github.com/gsdali/OCCTSwiftIO) | Headless CAD file I/O — STEP / IGES / STL / OBJ / BREP loaders + glTF / GLB / OBJ / PLY / STEP / BREP exporters. No Viewport dep. |
| [OCCTSwiftMesh](https://github.com/gsdali/OCCTSwiftMesh) | Mesh-domain algorithms — decimation, smoothing, repair (vendors `meshoptimizer`). |
| [OCCTSwiftViewport](https://github.com/gsdali/OCCTSwiftViewport) | Metal-based 3D viewport component (UIKit / AppKit / SwiftUI). |
| [OCCTSwiftTools](https://github.com/gsdali/OCCTSwiftTools) | Bridge layer: converts kernel `Shape` to `ViewportBody` with picking metadata. |
| [OCCTSwiftAIS](https://github.com/gsdali/OCCTSwiftAIS) | High-level interactive services — selection, manipulator widgets, dimension annotations, scene objects. |
| [OCCTSwiftScripts](https://github.com/gsdali/OCCTSwiftScripts) | `occtkit` CLI + ScriptHarness — JSON-driven verbs for compose / reconstruct / drawing-export / metrics / mesh / render-preview / XCAF. |
| [OCCTMCP](https://github.com/gsdali/OCCTMCP) | MCP server exposing CAD modeling to AI tools via Model Context Protocol. |
| [simpleOCCTVP](https://github.com/gsdali/simpleOCCTVP) | Pure C API over OCCT for non-Swift consumers — shape I/O, healing, mesh extraction, offscreen rendering. |

## Examples

### Sweep a Profile Along a Path

```swift
let profile = Wire.rectangle(width: 5, height: 3)
let path = Wire.arc(center: .zero, radius: 50, startAngle: 0, endAngle: .pi / 2)
let swept = Shape.sweep(profile: profile, along: path)
```

### XDE Document with Assembly Structure

```swift
let doc = try Document.load(from: stepURL)

for node in doc.rootNodes {
    print("Part: \(node.name ?? "unnamed")")
    if let color = node.color {
        print("  Color: \(color.red), \(color.green), \(color.blue)")
    }
    if let shape = node.shape {
        let mesh = shape.mesh(linearDeflection: 0.1)
        // render with Metal, SceneKit, RealityKit...
    }
}
```

### Parametric Curves for Metal Rendering

```swift
let curve = Curve3D.interpolate(points: [
    SIMD3(0, 0, 0), SIMD3(5, 10, 0), SIMD3(10, 0, 5)
])!
let points = curve.drawAdaptive(curvatureDeflection: 0.1)
// Feed to Metal vertex buffer
```

### GLTF Export

```swift
try Exporter.writeGLTF(shape: model, to: gltfURL)
try Exporter.writeGLB(shape: model, to: glbURL)
```

## Architecture

```
Sources/OCCTSwift/          Swift public API
Sources/OCCTBridge/include/ C function declarations (OCCTBridge.h)
Sources/OCCTBridge/src/     Objective-C++ implementations (OCCTBridge.mm)
Libraries/OCCT.xcframework  Pre-built OCCT 8.0.0 static library (arm64)
Tests/OCCTSwiftTests/       All tests (Swift Testing framework)
```

Three-layer design: **Swift API** -> **C bridge** (Objective-C++) -> **OCCT C++**

Each OCCT object is managed via opaque handle types with release-on-deinit. See [docs/architecture/overview.md](docs/architecture/overview.md) for details.

## Requirements
